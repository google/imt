Description: A toolkit for causal inference in experimental and observational 
    studies. Implements various simple Bayesian models including linear, 
    negative binomial, and logistic regression for impact estimation. 
    Provides functionality for randomization and checking baseline equivalence 
    in experimental designs. The package aims to simplify the process of 
    impact measurement for researchers and analysts across different fields.
